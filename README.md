# Alzheimer's Disease Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks:
## This project aims to compare the accuracy of our very own model with the models obtained from transfer learning.
for transfer learning, the project retrains the [Inception](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/image_retraining) model & the [Mobilenet](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.3/tutorials/image_retraining#other_model_architectures) model.

## Introduction:
Alzheimer’s disease is the leading cause of dementia and memory loss. Alzheimer’s disease, it is caused by atrophy of the certain brain regions. MRI scans reveal this information thus using a CNN for classifying these MRI images is very mucch possible. The Dataset used for this project is provided by [OASIS](http://www.oasis-brains.org/), which contains over 400 subjects 100 of which having mild to severe dementia and is supplemented by MMSE and CDR standards of diagnosis in the same context.
